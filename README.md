# 🐾 Roopik

Roopik (रूपिक) — from Sanskrit, meaning “representative” or “embodied form.”
It’s the ID card of your parallel self.

In Roopik, you are a user — here, on Earth.
When you load the app, it hands you your own alternate-universe badge, a simple, unchangeable snapshot of who you are in the Parallel Universe 🪐

## 🧠 What I Actually Learned

- How to **deploy weird little full-stackish things on Vercel** — static backends, dynamic vibes.
- Learned to craft a 144-cell interactive grid using React + Tailwind — each cell reacts to cursor movement with 3D depth, color, and scale.
- How to design and implement a cute favicon.
- Also aimated a cat in CSS 😭
